# vision shader
 
An Among Us/Ape Out vision shader.
Draw objects which will block vision onto a surface, then draw the surface using the shader which will draw a mask which can be used to your heart's content.
Takes a pixel width and height, the player x and y, as well as a radius as uniforms.

Currently does not function with surfaces that are not square.
Probably also horribly optimized.
